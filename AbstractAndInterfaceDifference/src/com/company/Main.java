         * Abstract Classes:
         * 1. Abstract Classes are similar to interfaces, you cannot instantiate them, and
         *      they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without implementation.
         *
         * 2. However, with Abstract Classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final,
         * and define public, protected, and private concrete methods.
         *
         * 3. An Abstract Class can extend only oner parent class but it can implement multiple interfaces.
         *
         * 4. When an Abstract Class is subClassed, the subClass usually provides implementations for all of
         * abstract methods in its parent class.
         *
         * 5. However, if it doesn't, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.
